#File Organizer for macOS
#File Organizer is a small and efficient Java-based utility designed for macOS users to automatically organize files within the Downloads folder. Upon downloading various files through web browsers or other applications, files often accumulate without any specific order. This utility eases the management of such files by categorizing and moving them to designated folders based on their file types.

#Features:
#Automated Sorting: Monitors the Downloads folder and automatically moves new files to specified folders, such as "Images", "PDFs", and more, depending on their extensions.
#Customizable Mapping: Easily configurable mappings that determine which file extensions go into which folders.
#Real-time Organization: Works in real-time, organizing files as soon as they are downloaded without any user intervention.
#Background Operation: Can be run as a background process, silently organizing files without disrupting user workflow.
#Minimal Setup: Requires minimal setup and can be triggered with a simple organize command in the terminal after initial configuration.
#This utility is intended to help users maintain a clean and organized workspace, reducing the clutter in the Downloads folder and saving time on manual file management.
